MATLAB Kernel PCA: PCA with training data , projection of new data 
====

## Overview
KernelPca.m is a MATLAB class file that enables you to do the following two things with very short code.
1. fitting a kernel pca model with training data with three kernel functions(gaussian, polynomial, linear)
1. projection of new data with the fitted pca model
Enjoy it!

## Demo
Run demo.m with KernelPca.m and data.mat.

![original data](https://github.com/kitayama1234/MATLAB-Kernel-PCA/blob/master/image1.jpg)

⇓ fit a kernel pca model with the training data  
⇓ project the train data by using the pca model  
⇓ project the test data as well
